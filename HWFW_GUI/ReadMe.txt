    WIN32 application：HWFW_GUI Project Overview
========================================================================

The application wizard has created this for you HWFW_GUI application。

This file outlines the contents of each of the files that make up the HWFW_GUI application.


HWFW_GUI.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for a VC++ project generated using AppWizard, and contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, as well as information about the platform, configuration, and project features selected using AppWizard.

HWFW_GUI.vcxproj.filters
    This is the VC++ project filter file generated using the Application Wizard. It contains information about the association between project files and filters. In the IDE, files with similar extensions are displayed in groups under a specific node through this association. For example, ".cpp" files are associated with the "Source Files" filter.

HWFW_GUI.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The AppWizard creates the following resources:

HWFW_GUI.rc
    This is a list of all Microsoft Windows resources used by the program. It includes icons, bitmaps, and cursors stored in the RES subdirectory. This file can be edited directly in Microsoft Visual C++.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file that can be used to define new resource IDs. Microsoft Visual C++ will read and update this file.

HWFW_GUI.ico
    This is the icon file used as the application icon (32x32). This icon is included in the main resource file HWFW_GUI.rc.

small.ico
    This is an icon file that contains a smaller version (16x16) of the application's icon. This icon is included in the main resource file HWFW_GUI.rc.

///////////////////////////////////////////// //////////////////////////
Other standard documents:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to generate a precompiled header (PCH) file named HWFW_GUI.pch and a precompiled type file named StdAfx.obj.
